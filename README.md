# Snake Game

## Introduction
Made a clone of the snake game using SDL2, SDL_ttf (to render fonts) and SDL_image (to render sprites). Learnt how to use vectors in C++.

## Start
Press P to start playing.

## Game
Use up, down, left, right to control the snake. Hitting the sides of the window would be considered as a collision and player loses.

Learning vectors helped for the snake movement.

## End
Once the snake collides against the window sides or onto itself, player loses and the window switches to show the end.
